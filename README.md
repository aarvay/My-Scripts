1] The Result Fetcher (resultfetcher.php)

This is a small script that I wrote to fetch the results of the Even Semester Exams of SASTRA University using CURL requests. 
Used Tamper Data to parse the postfields and fed it to the CURL. Simple.

2] KRDS Facecode 2011 (Problem #3) (process.php)

This is my main processing script for solving the problem 3 of KRDS Facecode 2011 Hackathon. Its a fully php oriented script that cuts down usage of database for processing huge amounts of data and identifying varied vocabulary in posts of friends of a user. It also does ranking!
